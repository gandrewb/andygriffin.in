		<p data-author="Red">It started months ago, a night where the fog was</p>
		<p data-author="Werewolf">rolling into the valley. He had just lost the woman of his dreams by a man dressed up as a piglet.</p>
		<p data-author="Dracula" class="hovered">He grabbed his trusty cat, Whiskers, and consoled himself to sleep. When he heard a tap on the window.</p>
		<p data-author="Blue" class="selected">He looked up and froze when he saw a vampire peering in the window.</p>
		<p data-author="Frankenstein">But then he realized it wasn't a vampire. It was Lord Voldemort, uh sorry, "He who must not be named."</p>
		<p data-author="Purple">"Say my name! Say my name!" Voldemort sang, his chilling voice compelling them toward the word, the name that would seal their doom.</p>
		<p data-author="Morticia">But they wouldn't say it, not when Harry's life was at stake.</p>
		<p data-author="Jack">So the torturer pulled out the secret weapon to get them to talk, the bleating fire alarm.</p>
		<p data-author="Keena">Slowly he turned up the alarm. As they tried to cover their ears, it just kept getting louder and louder until…</p>
		<p data-author="Andy">the bomb exploded, leaving nothing but a rocky crater in the middle of what was once a peaceful, thriving dwarf colony.</p>

		<p data-author="Lydia">Jessica Jensen badly wanted to eat the dead baby.</p>
		<p data-author="Red">She couldn't help herself because the experiments had taken their toll.</p>
		<p data-author="Dracula">She had finally discovered that a combination of whiskey, prayer and legos would turn him into a real man again.</p>
		<p data-author="Blue">Unfortunately, the consequences of the night before are irreversable.</p>
		<p data-author="Frankenstein">There was no way to possibly reverse this.</p>
		<p data-author="Purple">As the disease spread through his body and into his heart, his blue eyes became black as charcoal, his face suddenly the face of a phantom.</p>
		<p data-author="Morticia">He knew that if this really was the end, it was now or never — he needed to confess.</p>
		<p data-author="Jack">"Alright, Rachel did it. She knows the plan. I don't know anymore. What are you going to do to stop her, Brian?"</p>
		<p data-author="Keena">Brian squinting his eyes said, "I'm going to get her to tell me everything." And he grabbed his chapstick and took off to find her. But we never saw him or Rachel again.</p>

		<p data-author="Babadook">The man saw the eyes in the shadows watching.</p>
		<p data-author="Lydia">Sponge Bob’s squeaky shoes had given him away!</p>
		<p data-author="Red">Sticky blood clung to his shoes and he heard someone coming.</p>
		<p data-author="Werewolf">He tried to run and hide, but he slipped in all the blood before he could get away.</p>
		<p data-author="Dracula">Covered in blood, he stumbled into the car and stepped on the gas while checking the rear view mirror.</p>
		<p data-author="Blue">A body slid down the windshield.</p>
		<p data-author="Frankenstein">He had hit a bird once, and that slid down the windshield. But this was by far, way huge.</p>
		<p data-author="Purple">So huge that for a moment, it completely blocked her vision, and she drove over the guard rail, careening through the air over the canyon.</p>
		<p data-author="Morticia">She knew that she had less than a minute to get out of the car before she faced the Spirit World.</p>
		<p data-author="Jack">So she leaned over, using the other seatbelt to protect her before the crash (like Jason Bourne). The car came to a stop, and with the speed of a cheetah, she ran from the car just in time as it burst into flames. She thought, “Wow! What an adventure. I think I will stay home next time.”

		<p data-author="Norman">The night was dark and the demons were walking on the street.</p>
		<p data-author="Babadook">The children ran through the streets, terror flowing through them as they knew they were being hunted.</p>
		<p data-author="Lydia">But Candice Everdeen has a plan!</p>
		<p data-author="Red">She clutched a knife and steadied her breathing.</p>
		<p data-author="Werewolf">This was it; it was now or never.</p>
		<p data-author="Dracula">She took his hand, kissed her son goodbye, and jumped off the cliff.</p>
		<p data-author="Blue">The body washed up on the beach and was discovered by a young widow.</p>
		<p data-author="Frankenstein">Creepy enough, this widow knew who the body was. And she loved bodies — dead ones — with a creepy passion.</p>
		<p data-author="Purple">And what was more, this was a man she had loved in her youth, before his unfortunate demise.</p>
		<p data-author="Morticia">So obviously, she had to investigate before she could get any kind of closure. But, before she could, a semi het her. The end.</p>

		<p data-author="Victor">Once upon a time in the dark woods of EPA, one innocent young boy embarked on what would be the scariest journey of his short life.</p>
		<p data-author="Norman">His life was short because he had no legs. He was, as they say, “leg-less.” Crawling along the road, he saw what would change him forever.</p>
		<p data-author="Babadook">The witch stood, offering to make him a deal: his soul for a strong body of his own.</p>
		<p data-author="Lydia">He had always desired broad shoulders, bulging muscles, and a narrow waist like Brian Spencer.</p>
		<p data-author="Red">Brian had been his object of desire and he would undergo the dangerous surgeries no matter what!</p>
		<p data-author="Werewolf">No matter if he looked like Frankenstein, it be worth it.</p>
		<p data-author="Dracula">He knew his family would still love him, so he grabbed the knife, and started the process.</p>
		<p data-author="Blue">Within minutes, he was dead.</p>
		<p data-author="Frankenstein">Normally, a death wouldn’t surprise this group of hoodlums, but tonight it did. They were frightened.</p>
		<p data-author="Purple">This victim just wouldn’t stay dead… and that smile!</p>
		<p data-author="Morticia">But, in a sudden stroke of genius, he struck the victim on his nose. It worked! He died, and no one would know who killed him.</p>

		<p data-author="Brian">On a dark, stormy, misty, smelly night…</p>
		<p data-author="Victor">…Jane was walking through a dark alley covered in trash and rat excrement.</p>
		<p data-author="Norman">He couldn't help how hungry he was, so he walked to the trash ready to eat then saw the blood.</p>
		<p data-author="Babadook">It was everywhere, flowing from all crevices possible. Then a hand emerged and grabbed his wrist.</p>
		<p data-author="Lydia">The man was trying to stabilize him in preparation for his baptism.</p>
		<p data-author="Red">The Bishop who once seemed kind and loving, stood over him watching, waiting, and ready.</p>
		<p data-author="Werewolf">He had to be ready at a moment’s notice to take a strike.</p>
		<p data-author="Dracula">He took the gun, ran up the stairs, and shot the vampire.</p>
		<p data-author="Blue">Unfortunately, guns don’t work on vampires. So the vampire lunged toward the boy and drew blood from his neck.</p>
		<p data-author="Frankenstein">Thus the boy joined team Edward, and became part of the Twilight…</p>
		<p data-author="Purple">…sparkling in the sun but always jealous of how the girls scream when Jacob takes off his shirt. Did he make the right choice?</p>

		<p data-author="Bryce">Cindy walked into the bathroom and saw an infant.</p>
		<p data-author="Brian">No!!! This baby wasn't supposed to be here!</p>
		<p data-author="Victor">But there is was! And it was the strongest thing I had ever seen.</p>
		<p data-author="Norman">So I fought it. But it was stronger, punching me right through my heart. I could feel my heart stop beating.</p>
		<p data-author="Babadook">The darkness started to envelope me. Then it started eating me…</p>
		<p data-author="Lydia">like a fat kid eating donuts.</p>
		<p data-author="Red">The donuts came alive, forcing their way into his mouth.</p>
		<p data-author="Werewolf">It started with one. But then before he knew it, his mouth was full of them and he couldn't breathe.</p>
		<p data-author="Dracula">He felt the dirt pile upon him, worms in his mouth and knew the was the end.</p>
		<p data-author="Blue">He screamed, he cried, he drew what he thought was his last breath.</p>
		<p data-author="Frankenstein">Then, in the distance, his best friend from 3rd grade, the one with asthma, came and saved him.</p>

		<p data-author="Steph">Her dark hair mirrored the darkness of her heart.</p>
		<p data-author="Bryce">She floated through the dark forest seeking her first victim.</p>
		<p data-author="Brian">She was particular about her prey — they must be sweet and tender.</p>
		<p data-author="Victor">So she was patient and kept looking until she found the tenderest of all in a most peculiar place.</p>
		<p data-author="Norman">It was then that she started to burn everything around her. The world was on fire.</p>
		<p data-author="Babadook">The darkness was overthrown by the fire and she knew it would all be over soon.</p>
		<p data-author="Lydia">The anticipation was making her start to feel bloated!</p>
		<p data-author="Red">She struggled to calm herself, knowing that everything had changed.</p>
		<p data-author="Werewolf">She was no longer human; she was changed forever.</p>
		<p data-author="Dracula">As a vampire, she knew her life would be a life of eternal misery. She resigned herself to a life where her family would be safe.</p>
		<p data-author="Blue">They packed everything up and moved to Salt Lake.</p>

		<p data-author="Andy">In a castle on top of an old abandoned graveyard lived an old warlock.</p>
		<p data-author="Steph">No one knew where he got the money to buy it, but there were plenty of rumors.</p>
		<p data-author="Bryce">The scepter was jeweled and was known to make your darkest fears a reality.</p>
		<p data-author="Brian">"All behold the power of my scepter!" he commanded.</p>
		<p data-author="Victor">And they beheld and the entire crowd burst into dust!</p>
		<p data-author="Norman">Dust covered in blood. Blood that turned into a beholding crowd. It was then they saw it. Right before their eyes.</p>
		<p data-author="Babadook">A looming beast. Red eyes, bloody fangs, razor sharp claws. They knew it would begin feasting soon. Fight or flight.</p>
		<p data-author="Lydia">Then the fire alarm went off and it scared the beast so badly it peed.</p>
		<p data-author="Red">The village people screamed in terror of the beast.</p>
		<p data-author="Werewolf">They fought together and slew the mighty animal, but many brave souls were lost in the effort.</p>
		<p data-author="Dracula">It was a valiant effort fought against the mighty pirate Catlion, but the days would always be remembered as sadness and glory for the werewolf clan.</p>

		<p data-author="Keena">She woke up in the coffin and when she went to open it…</p>
		<p data-author="Andy">A large hairy spider fell on her hand and growled.</p>
		<p data-author="Steph">"That's weird," she thought, "I didn't know spiders could growl."</p>
		<p data-author="Bryce">Suddenly the growling arachnid jumped toward her face, fangs dripping with poison.</p>
		<p data-author="Brian">"Begone, dark one!" she shrieked. She pulled out her secret weapon…</p>
		<p data-author="Victor">A giant purple-people-eater! She let it loose on the dark one and then…</p>
		<p data-author="Norman">It exploded into dust.</p>
		<p data-author="Babadook">They knew then, that it was over.</p>
		<p data-author="Lydia">The end, or was it?…</p>
		<p data-author="Red">This story was told over and over, terrifying everyone. Because everything would never be the same.</p>
		<p data-author="Werewolf">Even though things were forever changed, at least they had each other.</p>

		<p data-author="Jack">Alex Madsen decided to go for a walk through the dark, thick forest on a full moon night…</p>
		<p data-author="Keena">…until he came to a shaking little girl all by herself.</p>
		<p data-author="Andy">She was inconsolable and could hardly speak, but forced out the words, “I can’t breathe.”</p>
		<p data-author="Steph">No one in the room believed her, except for one man who had just entered the side door.</p>
		<p data-author="Bryce">His pale, deformed face glared at everyone present. “I killed the child.”</p>
		<p data-author="Brian">“Impossible,” I cried. "Because the murderer has already fled the continent."</p>
		<p data-author="Victor">But he hadn't! At that moment he jumped from the pile of dung he was hiding in!</p>
		<p data-author="Norman">But the dung lit on fire and he burned to death.</p>
		<p data-author="Babadook">His eyes opened to darkness. "Welcome to Hell," a dark looming voice said.</p>
		<p data-author="Lydia">The fright was so bad that he pooped!</p>
		<p data-author="Red">He crumpled to the floor, dying of a heart attack.</p>

		<p data-author="Morticia">One dark Halloween night there was a happy serial killer.</p>
		<p data-author="Jack">He decided to start his usual business with a fine dinner, calling on cherished neighbors.</p>
		<p data-author="Keena">As people arrived to the dinner they greeted the strange looking doorman.</p>
		<p data-author="Andy">As they walked by, he gave them a stiff poke in the ribs with his cane.</p>
		<p data-author="Steph">Unfortunately, the poke didn't accomplish its intended purpose.</p>
		<p data-author="Bryce">So he grabbed the women by the throat. "Tell me where you hid the talisman!"</p>
		<p data-author="Brian">She laughed a deep, throaty laugh, that sent a chill into his soul.</p>
		<p data-author="Victor">And then she looked him in the eye, preparing for her final strike. But he was ready…</p>
		<p data-author="Norman">Ready to poop.</p>
		<p data-author="Babadook">But then… constipation! Duh duh duh!!</p>
		<p data-author="Lydia">But there was so much poop nothing could hold it back. The end.</p>

		<p data-author="Purple">Three steps down the dark path, Michael ran into a…</p>
		<p data-author="Morticia">…huge oak tree. He screamed like Miley does when someone makes her dress modestly.</p>
		<p data-author="Jack">He jumped for joy, running in circles and leaping for joy, as all nature seemed to come together for this moment, birds singing, squirrels watching.</p>
		<p data-author="Keena">A girl then approached him and asked for help to the cemetery.</p>
		<p data-author="Andy">He led her straight to an open grave and pushed her in.</p>
		<p data-author="Steph">She screamed and screamed as she fell — it seemed that this grave had no bottom.</p>
		<p data-author="Bryce">She slammed into the ground, shattering all the bones in her body.</p>
		<p data-author="Brian">“Oh crap! That hurt!”</p>
		<p data-author="Victor">he said painfully as his arm fell to the ground.</p>
		<p data-author="Norman">It was done. His heart stopped and he died. Totally dead.</p>
		<p data-author="Babadook">But then he woke up as a zombie!! Plot twist!</p>

	<article>
		<p data-author="Frankenstein">On a frozen dark morning, ice zombies came out of Lake Erie!</p>
		<p data-author="Purple">One at a time, a cold, lifeless army, they came inexorably forward, closer with every minute.</p>
		<p data-author="Morticia">And everyone was wondering what would happen next.</p>
		<p data-author="Jack">Just then, a door creaked, and the lights went out.</p>
		<p data-author="Keena">In fear, he called out “Is anyone there?” but no one answered as the air got cold.</p>
		<p data-author="Andy">He could see his breath as he let out a low, heavy groan.</p>
		<p data-author="Steph">It was chillier than he expected for a typical October evening.</p>
		<p data-author="Bryce">The poison in his blood caused a delirium that drove him mad.</p>
		<p data-author="Brian">And I mean, really mad. You could say he was livid. Or angry. Or flippin’ pissed.</p>
		<p data-author="Victor">So mad, that his whole body began to convulse involuntarily.</p>
		<p data-author="Norman">Then he woke up daed… the next day.</p>

	<article>
		<p data-author="Blue">The killer watched his next victim through the foggy window…</p>
		<p data-author="Frankenstein">…and loaded his nerf gun with vigor and vim.</p>
		<p data-author="Purple">Despite humming his favorite hymn, he couldn’t shake the feeling that he was being watched.</p>
		<p data-author="Morticia">He thought about praying but figured that probably wasn’t appropriate given the situation.</p>
		<p data-author="Jack">So he decided to call Brian, his best friend, and ask what he thought. Brian said:</p>
		<p data-author="Keena">“This is starting to feel like someone’s watching us.” and Bryce…</p>
		<p data-author="Andy">…stabbed her in the stomach with is gentlemanly scepter.</p>
		<p data-author="Steph">Blood gushed out and she collapsed on the floor.</p>
		<p data-author="Bryce">The children saw her and screamed so loud and long that blood spewed out of their eyes.</p>
		<p data-author="Brian">Which, I don’t even have to mention, was really gross!</p>
		<p data-author="Victor">In fact, it was so gross that everyone except for the romantic interests in the story fainted! The lovebirds got away and lived happily ever after.</p>

		<p data-author="Dracula">One dark and scary, stormy night there was a family of elves in a cellar.</p>
		<p data-author="Blue">The elves were plotting their next attack.</p>
		<p data-author="Frankenstein">Once they had their Keebler cookies in their pouches, and their ears pointed up, they screamed like only elves can, "Tonight, we ride!"</p>
		<p data-author="Purple">Out they rode with reckless abandon across the plain of despair, barely daring to hope they would make it in time.</p>
		<p data-author="Morticia">But as they were riding, they ran into Michael Jackson's ghost (too soon?)</p>
		<p data-author="Jack">Michael Jackson was singing "123 ABC." As Michael Jackson passed by, she turned to Alex and asked, "Alex, what is going on?"</p>
		<p data-author="Keena">But Alex just screamed seeing Michael alive from the dead and ran saying "I love your music!"</p>
		<p data-author="Andy">But when he turned around, he had sprouted fangs, fur and claws.</p>
		<p data-author="Steph">She was so shocked that she couldn't even hear herself scream.</p>
		<p data-author="Bryce">The demon's cold, clawed hands reached for her throat.</p>
		<p data-author="Brian">And caressed it gently. "My sweet Caroline," he croaked. "Why did you leave me?" He sputtered, gasped and returned to the hellish place he had come from. The end.</p>

		<p data-author="Werewolf">On dark, dreary, damp night, a man walked through an alley.</p>
		<p data-author="Dracula">And ran into a scantily clad figure.</p>
		<p data-author="Blue">Call the police or approach the person — that is the question.</p>
		<p data-author="Frankenstein">So they called the police and Colonel Sanders answered, “Come to die with your city have you?</p>
		<p data-author="Purple">No more will Chick-fil-A rule this town with its army of cows!” said the Colonel.</p>
		<p data-author="Morticia">He knew that if KFC was ever going to get out of this financial crisis, he’d have to take the Chick out.</p>
		<p data-author="Jack">So he called his friend who does “Dirty Deeds” and they hatched a plan to take care of the chicken. It started by taking a fryer to grandma’s house.</p>
		<p data-author="Keena">Then they grabbed a bag and some duct tape to keep grandma quiet.</p>
		<p data-author="Andy">He writhed and struggled as his breath slowed and the world grew dark.</p>
		<p data-author="Steph">As the world dimmed around him, he wondered if this really was the end.</p>
		<p data-author="Bryce">And it was!</p>
