				<h3>The Wheel 2014</h3>
				<p>The Wheel is a randomized quiz game used for training purposes that is fully customizable via a JSON file, including the choice between two different gameplay modes. Itʼs built using web-based technologies, but in a way that mimics native functionality and is responsive to different device sizes. I collaborated on the design, and wrote all the code.</p>

				<h3>The Grid 2014</h3>
				<p>The Grid was the next generation of web-based iPad games that was designed to work fully offline and to be user-customizable without any code. I made extensive use of local storage, cache manifests and base64 encoding to create an experience that imitated that of native apps — including sound effects, animations and speedy touch responsiveness. I was entirely responsible for both the design and the code.</p>

				<h3>Hangman &amp; Timeline Quiz 2013</h3>
				<p>These two training games made use of the same drag-and-drop implementation as their primary interaction. They work both with multitouch and a mouse. Incorrect answers rattle around and are rejected. I collaborated on the design, and wrote all the code.</p>

				<h3>Web Form Framework 2014</h3>
				<p>This form started out as a request for a single form that mimicked native iOS 7 style and appearance. But it eventually became an entire form-building framework that could be adapted for any form and is fully responsive. It changes to a two-column layout in larger viewports and includes perfect imitations of iOS toggle switches and buttons in both appearance and behavior. I collaborated on the design, and wrote all the code.</p>

				<h3>WebCast System 2012</h3>
				<p>This was my intern project for Apple. It was designed to replace an outdated webcast portal and made huge visual, security and usability improvements. Users and stakeholders were initially interviewed to find the pain points of the old system. Login was streamlined, the chat system became far less error-prone, webcast scheduling, creation and management was simplified and organized, and the ability to host multiple webcasts at once was developed. I was entirely responsible for both the design and the code.</p>
